# Info_search

Just like the name, the program searches the information and prints the information of the given symbol number. The program was written solely for the student information management system. It can take the information given by user for any given 'n' number of students as input, can store them in a '.csv' file, search the information based on the symbol number provided by the user and can even delete the infomation. 

The program is written in C language. C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. I have written it in C as this program being the program I was trying out after completing my C classes.

It being the First version till date, it is simple and lacks better features. Currently, it has simple features like store, search and delete. Symbol number being the vital part of information in all of those features.

## Working Process

After getting the command from the user on what the user desires to do, it opens the appropriate terminal. Again, after getting the command in the new terminal as requested by the user previously, it does the work requested by the user. 

If the command is to store the information, it stores the information in a csv file named "data.csv". All the information are stored in this file. The first line of the file shows on which format the information are stored. If any problem arises during opening of the file, an error message is displayed in the screen. Commands are taken in the form of number, with each command being given a specific number, as all the required command are presented on the screen before taking command from the user.
